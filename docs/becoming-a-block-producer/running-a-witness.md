# Becoming a block producer

For becoming a block producer you have to get a synced node with the network. To reach to that state, let's get the needed ingredients to start our node.

Let's set a folder in our system where we will store both our secrets and the data of our node.

```bash
export BASE_PATH=~/ebakus-producer

mkdir -p ${BASE_PATH}
```

!!! important
    This doc refers on how to become a block producer on the **mainnet** which is not launched yet. If you would like to experiment on **testnet** add the `--testnet` flag.

## Create an account for the block producer

### Create a password file for your account

It's up to you to decide how to generate the password for your account. Here you can find an example command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32 > ${BASE_PATH}/passwd
```

### Create the account

```bash
docker run --rm --name ebakus-producer \
    -v ${BASE_PATH}:/root \
    -p 30403:30403 \
    -p 30403:30403/udp \
    ebakus/go-ebakus \
        account new \
            --password /root/passwd
```

!!! example "Example output"
    ```
    Your new key was generated

    Public address of the key:   0xA356eF85BB1740eC494B3c4eDA230aBd64D571F8
    Path of the secret key file: /root/.ebakus/keystore/UTC--2019-12-17T13-44-28.902899300Z--a356ef85bb1740ec494b3c4eda230abd64d571f8
    ```

From the above we need to note our public address. That is `0xA356eF85BB1740eC494B3c4eDA230aBd64D571F8` in this example.

## Start the producer

We start our producer, having opened the `30403` port in the docker for connecting to the P2P network. We then set our `nodekey`, `etherbase` and `password` as well unlocking the account.

```bash
docker run -d --name ebakus-producer \
    -v ${BASE_PATH}:/root \
    -p 30403:30403 \
    -p 30403:30403/udp \
    ebakus/go-ebakus \
        --etherbase 0xA356eF85BB1740eC494B3c4eDA230aBd64D571F8 \
        --unlock 0xA356eF85BB1740eC494B3c4eDA230aBd64D571F8 \
        --password /root/passwd
```

## Monitor syncing

Now we have to wait for the node to be synced. We can check the progress by attaching to the docker container like:

```bash
docker exec -it ebakus-producer ebakus attach
```

Inside the attached console we can check if we are currently syncing which has to return `false`.

```js
> eth.syncing
false
```

And also to check if the blockNumber is the latest one in our [explorer](https://explorer.ebakus.com/blocks) as well.

```js
> eth.blockNumber
```


## Elect as a witness

For electing ourselves as a witness we have to send a transaction on the main system contract `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000101`. For doing so we need to attach to the docker container:

```bash
docker exec -it ebakus-producer ebakus attach
```

And send the transaction:

```js
> var tx = {
    from: eth.coinbase,
    to: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000101',
    data: '0xe0a1ea960000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001',
    nonce: eth.getTransactionCount(eth.coinbase)
};
> tx.gas = eth.estimateGas(tx);

> var txWithPow = eth.calculateWorkNonce(tx, eth.suggestDifficulty(eth.coinbase));

> eth.sendTransaction(txWithPow);
```

    For more information on PoW check [here](../developing-applications-with-ebakus/proof-of-work.md).

## Start the producer

Once you are ready, set node active for producing.

```bash
docker exec -it ebakus-producer ebakus attach
```

```js
> miner.start()
true
```

!!! tip
    After the initial sync and being added as a witness you can add `--mine` flag in the docker startup script for auto mining. Also you ask docker to automatically restart when something happens `--restart unless-stopped` in the docker params.


## Be voted

In order to produce a block you need to be in the top 100 witnesses. For doing this help the community and ask others to vote you.

!!! tip
    Don't forget to vote for yourself!!! ðŸ˜€
