# Ebakus Web Wallet

This is the official web wallet which can be embedded into a dApp page to interact with the Ebakus blockchain.

You can check the [released mainnet wallet](https://wallet.ebakus.com) and check how it looks like inside a dApp at [an existing dApp](https://ebakus.dslots.one).

## Usage

The suggested way of interacting with the wallet is to use the [ebakus web wallet loader](./wallet-loader.md) which loads the wallet in an iframe and provides an interface between your dApp and the ebakus wallet without giving you access to your keys. It also allows many dApps share the same wallet when running in the same browser.

In case you would like to self host the wallet, you can get your own version from its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ebakus/ebakus-web-wallet).
