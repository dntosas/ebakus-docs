When building your own dApp there is a need to connect with a node in order to read and write to the Ebakus blockchain. It is adviced to run your own node for your dApp in order to perform faster and control that your service is always online.

!!! tip "Advice"
    Please be kind and start your own node for your dApp if you have traffic.
